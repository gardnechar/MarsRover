Title: MarsRover Application 
Language: Java
Owner: Chas Gardner

Instructions:
This application was built in Eclipse JDE. I have provided an executable jar file and the original project eclipse files.
To run the application you can either import the jar file into Eclipse or you can paste the original project folder 'MarsRover' provided,
into your Eclipse workspace and run the project.

The application prints instrustions to the user through the console log and allows the user to enter in commands also through the console log
to set the map and control the rover.

Any problems you can contact me through email 'gardner.chas@gmail.com'
